# Project Link ----> [Link](https://searchdeveloperprofile.netlify.app/)

## Project Overview
 #### The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly search interface that connects to the GitHub API to search for developer profiles. The user will input a GitHub username, and the application will display the developer's profile information, such as their name, bio, repositories, and more, by making an API request to GitHub. The front end will consist of HTML, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to handle the interaction with the API.

## Technologies Used
 ### HTML: To create the structure of the web page.
 ### CSS: To style the page, ensuring it's visually appealing and easy to use.
 ### JavaScript: To handle API requests and update the UI dynamically based on user input.




## Key Features

>### Search Bar: A simple input field where the user can type in a GitHub username.

>### Display Results: After a successful API call, the results are displayed in an easy-to-read format, showing details such as:

 ## User's profile picture
* ### Full name
* ### Bio
* ### Number of public repositories
* ### Followes
* ### Following

### Error Handling: If the username is invalid or no results are found, the user is shown an appropriate error message.
